Current:
	Set of itemsets {X}
	pick x,y belongs to X such that  x intersection y = emptyset
		check for confidencemenasure ( sup ( x intersection y )/n^2 - sup(x)*sup(y)/n^2 )
	Write a function that evaluates support(A intersection B) given itemset A and B

Future:
	Make changes so that we have the full fp tree and not remove nodes of less support
	Write anoter function that evaluates support( A union B )
